# Script Bots

ScriptBots is an Open Source Evolutionary Artificial Life Simulation of Predator-Prey dynamics.

## Code Example



## Motivation

I love learning about [Artificial Neural Networks](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) and [Genetic Algorithms](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm), creating an artificially intelligent robot has always been one of my Childhood Geek dreams. I stumbled on some interesting YouTube videos a while back that really sparked my interest. Since then I have decided to start working on ScriptBots witch already has a small contributor base.
